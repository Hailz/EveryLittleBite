# Approach Taken:

  ## Day 1 & Day 2:
  I really wanted to build this site out using Ionic. I spent day one and day two researching Ionic and trying to learn TypeScript, Cordova, Angular 2, Ionic v2 and v3, and several various backend db options it allowed for. In the end I couldn't find information reliable enough for me to feel I could build out all that I wanted to build within my remaining three days so I switched gears to a MEAN stack app.

  ## Day 3:
  I got the pantry and user dbs up and connected. I built out an API that we're going to populate with food images and information because I couldn't find one that offerred the information I needed.

  ## Day 4:
  I finished getting a recipe API connected and built an admin controller to help prevent access to admin pages. 

  ## Day 5:
  Working on styling and some debugging.

# Roadbumps:
Not being able to get Ionic to work within this time frame was very dissapointing and frustrating. Ionic just updated to v3 and I believe that is why the tutorials I was finding weren't working. In the end it was just going to be too much to learn and build in a week.
